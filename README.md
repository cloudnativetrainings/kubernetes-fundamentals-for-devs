# Kubernetes Fundamentals for Developers Training Labs

This training environment is designed to work with GitHub Codespaces and/or devcontainers on VSCode.

## Setup training environment

Please run the `pre-checks.sh` script to make sure that all required components are running:

```bash
./pre-checks.sh
```

Start the codespaces on the repo, wait until the setup is ready, and start with the [01_configmaps](./01_configmaps/README.md) lab.
